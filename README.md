Dharma Overground Theme


## Contribution

My recommendation is to work from the static HTML file at static/stuff_vs_practice.html. It references the main theme-specific CSS file, which is at theme/css/dho.css. So to work on the theme, load the stuff_vs_practice.html page in a browser, and dho.css in your favorite editor, and have a go at it. Send a pull request when you have made some progress, and we'll get it merged.

## Building the theme

To build the liferay theme archive, run bin/build.rb from the command line. The WAR file will be produced in the build directory, which you can then upload to the liferay server.
